In this blog I plan to introduce to you my research by first introducing inverse problems (i.e. parameter estimation) and challenges in systems biology. Bringing them together I will show how the work I did with my advisor, Dr. U. Abdulla, was an important contribution.

I'm excited to begin even if only in small pieces at a time. I hope you'll join me in this journey!
